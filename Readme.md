# Glofsense - Early Prediction of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF)

## Overview
Glofsense is a cutting-edge platform designed for the early prediction of **Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs)** in the **Hindukush region**. It leverages multiple data sources and advanced analytics to provide early warnings and insights into potential flooding events.

## Key Components
Glofsense predicts GLOFs using the following three approaches:

### 1. **Hardware-Based Prediction**
- **Sensor Deployment:** Sensors are installed in glacial lakes to collect real-time data.
- **Predictive Analytics:** A machine learning model analyzes sensor data to detect anomalies and forecast potential floods.
- **Sensor Types:**
  - **Floating Sensors:** Altitude, Humidity, Latitude, Longitude, Temperature, Water Temperature, Gyroscope (X, Y, Z axes).
  - **Moraine-Attached Sensors:** Humidity, Temperature, Vibration, Flow Velocity.

### 2. **SAR Image Analysis**
- Uses **Sentinel-1 GRD** SAR imagery.
- Analyzes **Gamma0 backscatter values** to track glacial lake changes.
- Machine learning models predict flood risk based on SAR imagery patterns.

### 3. **DEM Analysis**
- Uses **Digital Elevation Models (DEM)** to simulate water flow from glacial lakes.
- Analyzes **TIFF files** to evaluate slopes, water accumulation, and drainage patterns.
- Predicts potential flood paths based on topography.

### 4. **Camera Interface**
- Real-time monitoring through **live camera feeds** placed near glacial lakes.
- Identifies visual changes in terrain, ice melting, or other environmental shifts.

## Features
- **Multi-Source Data Fusion:** Combines sensor data, SAR images, DEM analysis, and camera feeds.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Sends early warnings in case of detected anomalies.
- **Web-Based Dashboard:** Interactive UI for monitoring live data, graphs, and risk assessment.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes **XGBoost, CNNs, and GIS-based algorithms** for accurate predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Web-based dashboard for visualization and analysis.
